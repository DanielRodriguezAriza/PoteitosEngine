# Poteitos Engine

## Introduction
Welcome to the Poteitos Engine repository.
This project is a very simple game engine built using C++ and Legacy OpenGL, built for an university class project.
The purpose of this project was to attempt building a game engine from scratch and a game in said engine.
Future versions of the engine will be implemented with modern OpenGL and actual shader programming to achieve better results and implement more complex features.

## Features
- **Feature 1:** [Explain the first key feature of your project]
- **Feature 2:** [Describe the second important feature]
- **Feature 3:** [Highlight another significant aspect]

## Installation
The project is implemented in Visual Studio using C++. No, I did not use Visual Studio by choice, this was a requirement for my class. I do not enjoy pain, I swear.
To get started with Poteitos Engine, follow these installation steps:

1. Download Visual Studio
2. Open the Solution
3. Profit

The project files can be downloaded and compiled manually if you dislike using IDEs as much as I do.

## Usage
Once you have installed the project, you can begin using the simple classes implemented in the Poteitos Engine to create your own game logic.
The game itself is implemented in the Game.h and Game.cpp files, which is where you will find the example game that was built with Poteitos Engine.

All the objects can be initialized either by using new or allocating enough memory for them.
